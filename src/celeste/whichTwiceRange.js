/**
whichTwiceRange - (easy-medium)

We have an array of n + 1 numbers. Every number in the range 1..n appears once
except for one number that appears twice.

Write a function for finding the number that appears twice. We can do this
in O(n) time and O(1) space! Don't forget the range described above is a
triangular series ðŸ˜‰

call your function whichTwiceRange()
